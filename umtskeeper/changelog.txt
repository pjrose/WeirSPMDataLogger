2.07

20151004
- Fixed finish init before resetmonth, resettransferstats, resetratestats
  command parsing.
- Fixed remaining MBytes/day display.
- Fixed wrong transfer counters if the connection is up already on program
  launch.

20150927
- Fixed a typo. (thanks Robert)

20150924
- Fixed unexpected program termination in DDNS updater if the provider fails to
  return an IP on 'good' update message. Also added some more handling for
  out-of-specification returns. (thanks Johan)
- Added Python version to log on startup.
- Removed CPU hungry stat variable sorting which is really only a debugging
  convenience.
  
20150315
- Fixed variable reference error in the update routine.

20150228.1000
- Fixed a variable reference fatal error in the DNS updater that was introduced 
  in 2.07. (thanks Tomas)

20150220
- Added option to reboot the system if an already attached modem could not 
  be mode-switched. This proved to work on systems such as the Rasperry Pi which
  may be powered on with the modem attached.
- Added option for e-mail notification on IP change. (thanks Jan)
- Replaced external USB reset program by Python function. This eliminates 
  compatibility issues with ARM architectures. (thanks Matthias)
- Updated the included Sakis3G to newest version.
- Fixed initialisation routine where it would cause logic failure.
- Cleaned up main connection loop.


2.06

20140614
- Added periodic DNS lookup for the case that the modem hangs and Sakis3G does
  not detect this from the system status. Because this should happen very rarely
  if ever, I could not really test it. Therefore any feedback on this function
  is welcome.
  Adds config: conf['DNSprobeDomain'], conf['DNSprobeCycle']
- Cosmetic changes to HTML interface.


2.05

20140515
- Minor cleanup in code and log messages (no reason for upgrade).

20140503
- Finally made help text (and python docstring) work.
- Corrected version number (20140430 build was still labeled 2.04-20140220).

20140430
- Added the Sakis3G program (binary-free version) to the download. This should 
  simplify download and install.
- Fixed "variable referenced before assignment" error when trying to retrieve a
  Sakis3G error message.
- A little cosmetics with the logs.


2.04

20140220
- Added check on date change, if year changed.
- Fixed "fail to update stats on new month as per monthstartday setting".
- Fixed menu buttons to default to show all graphs.

20140120
- Enabling the internal webserver by command line argument would disable writing
  a HTML file to disk, regardless of the 'writeHTMLStats' configuration.

20140119
- Fixed a bug that made the DNS updater work incorrectly if user chose to not 
  keep statistics.
- Fixed bug that invoked DNS update on every HTML page reload if you had done a 
  manual update (no harm done, only log annoyance).

20140112
- Added catching of errors while loading the stats file. It will now simply 
  ignore a failure to execute the stats file(s). The malformed stats file will 
  be saved as umtskeeper.stat.err (thanks Stanislav)
- Removed too alarming message "No PID file found" on normal startup. This is 
  only necessary when a "stop" command was invoked.

20140107.2350
- Changed log message ("DOWN") on program start when Sakis3G connect is 
  called. I'm not sure about the reliability of information if the modem is 
  reported as "already connected". Often enough, my modem LED signalled 
  'online' when indeed the internet was unreachable. Therefore, connect in any 
  case and just change the log message.
- Added a 'logLevel' setting. This may only be useful in development.
- Don't store backups of the stats file in the log file. During half a year of
  use, the statistics were never lost with me (unlike in v.1), meaning that the
  clean shutdown works well enough. This backup can be switched on by setting 
  conf['logLevel']=3 or higher.


2.03

20140107.2300
- Fixed unhandled exception in dDNS updater. (thanks Marcus)

20140107
- Fixed "automatic reload of HTML file forwards to root path of the server
  instead". (thanks Marco)

20140106
- Fixed "stats are not aware of new year until the configured monthstartday has
  passed". Happy new Year :)
- Fixed "global name 'httpD' is not defined" error in cleanup function on
  program exit.

20131205
- Fixed "style sheet not found when conf['htmlPath'] is given". (thanks Stefano)
- Made stats page react immediately to button clicks when
  conf['writeHTMLStats']=True.
- Made path configurations also work without the trailing slash.

20131203
- Fixed "404 error due to HTML file not written although
  conf['writeHTMLStats']=True". (thanks Stefano)

20130806
- Minor fixes.

20130722.22
- Shutdown HTTP socket on program exit.
- Added retry if IP could not be obtained from URL. (fixed with .22)

20130720
- Delay IP updater with logonly option when connection established (wait for
  network ready).

20130718
- Added log view and some interactivity to HTML page.
- Added some config vars for HTML page.
- Added robots.txt for discouraging spiders from indexing the stats page.
- Security Fix: calling Sakis3G through shell opened shell access to user.


2.02

20130717.18
- Fixed bug in determining config changes in DDNS updater.

20130717
- Added Dynamic DNS (DDNS) update client.


2.01

20130709.00
- Fixed type error with "wron PIN" message.
- Changed graph to show expected 95-percentile instead of current median (which
  turnd out rather meaningless).

20130707.17
- Fixed Sakis calls with writing to log when program did not wait for Sakis to
  finish.
- Fixed connect command.
- Fixed type error on USB reset. (thanks Jan)
- Fixed "try to reset USB device which is not present". (thanks Jan)
- Fixed "program exit if old process not found".

20130706
- Tweaked the graphs a bit.
- Added "connect" command, that causes connection to resume if it was suspended
  by --sakismaxfails.
- Added IP whitelisting for HTTP server.


2.00

20130702
Umtskeeper2 is a complete re-write of the program in Python.

Why Python?
  Because it is a proper programming language. BASH scripting is good for some
  things and poor at other things. It's really only piling calls of mini-
  programs together. The syntax becomes accordingly complicated. Python is a
  powerful language with lots of advantages for this purpose, among them:
- Powerful data handling: lists, dictionaries, type conversions. For example,
  getting a median from a list of values, which involves sorting of the list in
  nested loops, can be a one-liner in Python: median=sorted(list)[len(list)/2].
- Floating-point math! Yes, my computer sports a coprocessor :) Yours too?
- Lots of modules for just about anything are included. For example, UMTSkeeper
  has its own mini-webserver now which is only a few lines of code and the
  inclusion of a standard module.
- Comes with a debugger. Frustration with debugging is little. Things tend to
  work. Documentation and examples are plenty.
- Runs quite fast. Although it is still an interpreter language, the
  interpreter will store the program as intermediate code on first run, so that
  it will not have to be interpreted constantly. With UMTSkeeper2, your machine
  will therefore be that 1% more enveronmental-friendly :)
- Not least, there's rat in it.

What's new?
- Support for a configuration file, so there's an end to endless command lines.
- A few parameters were added, notably:
  maxSakisFails, sakisFailLockDuration: prevent Sakis3G from draining your
    battery if no modem is plugged.
  writeHTMLStats: disable writing of the HTML file.
  --noroot switch: force all data to be written to program directory, so that
    we don't need root access.
- Data is now primarily kept in the system temporary directory which is a
  virtual file system in RAM. This is especially good with devices like the
  Raspberry Pi that run from an SD card.
- Proper program shutdown, also when killed by ctrl+c or through other signals.
  Program can be ended with the command "umtskeeper quit".
- HTTP server to serve the statistics page(s). Enable it with
  --httpserver (commandline) or conf['httpServer']=True (configfile). By
  default, it serves at port 8000, so the page is reached from your network at
  http://ip.of.machine:8000/
- More sophisticated transfer statistics. You'll see that I like to play with
  them. Graphs are now in SVG format. Much of this is experimental and will be
  subject to change in the upcoming versions. Your old statistics will be
  converted to a new format but they will not be that accurate. There are
  commands to reset these numbers.

What next? A few things are still planned:
- Investigate running the thing as a real deamon, which should allow to run it
  without log-in on stand-alone headless systems. Install/uninstall,
  rc-scripts, logrotate.
- Basic dynamic DNS update client - good for remote monitoring.
- Probably make some more use of the webserver.
- Get connect/disconnect markers into the graphs.
